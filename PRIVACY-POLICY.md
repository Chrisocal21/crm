# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## Introduction

ANCHOR by Probably Fine Studios ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application.

## Information We Collect

### Data Storage

Our CRM system uses **browser localStorage** exclusively for data storage. This means:

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No data is stored in cloud databases
- All information remains on your device

### Types of Data Stored

When you use our CRM, the following data is stored locally:

- **Business Information**: Company name, contact details, business settings
- **Client Records**: Client names, contact information, custom fields, tags
- **Orders & Quotes**: Order details, quotes, bids, pricing information
- **Invoices**: Invoice data, payment records, amounts
- **Tasks & Timesheets**: Task assignments, work logs, hours tracked
- **Calendar & Timeline**: Scheduled events, deadlines, appointments
- **User Settings**: Preferences, saved views, bookmarks, workflow settings
- **Authentication Data**: User accounts, login credentials, portal access codes
- **File Attachments**: Documents uploaded through the file attachment system (Base64 encoded)

### Data You Provide

You directly provide all data stored in the CRM through:
- Manual data entry
- File uploads
- Form submissions
- Configuration settings

## How We Use Your Information

Since all data is stored locally in your browser:

- **We do not access your data** - Data never leaves your device
- **We do not share your data** - No third-party access to your information
- **We do not sell your data** - No data is collected or monetized
- **We do not analyze your data** - No analytics or tracking of your CRM usage

Your data is used exclusively by you to:
- Manage client relationships
- Track orders and projects
- Generate invoices and quotes
- Schedule tasks and appointments
- Monitor business analytics

## Data Security

### Local Storage Security

- **Browser Protection**: Data security depends on your browser's security and your device security
- **Access Control**: Only users with access to your device and browser can view the data
- **No Transmission**: Since data is never transmitted, there's no risk of interception
- **Encryption**: Standard browser localStorage security applies

### Your Responsibility

To protect your data:
- ✅ Use strong passwords for user accounts
- ✅ Keep your device secure with screen locks
- ✅ Don't share portal access codes publicly
- ✅ Log out when using shared devices
- ✅ Regularly backup your data using the export feature
- ✅ Use updated browsers with security patches

## Data Retention

- **Storage Duration**: Data persists in localStorage until you explicitly delete it
- **Manual Deletion**: You can delete individual records or clear all data through Settings
- **Browser Clearing**: Clearing browser data will remove all CRM information
- **Backups**: We recommend regular exports to JSON for data backup

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

### Right to Access
- All your data is directly accessible in the CRM interface
- Export feature allows you to download all data as JSON

### Right to Modify
- Edit any record at any time through the CRM interface
- Update settings and preferences as needed

### Right to Delete

### Right to Export

The only browser storage used is localStorage for CRM data persistence.
