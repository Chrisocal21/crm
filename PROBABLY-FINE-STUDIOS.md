# Probably Fine Studios

Probably Fine Studios is a small, independent studio focused on building useful, thoughtful tools.

We value shipping early, refining often, and keeping things simple. Products may evolve quickly, but the goal is always the same: make something that works, feels intentional, and improves with use.

## Studio Principles

* **Utility over hype**
  Tools should be helpful first. Marketing comes last.

* **Iteration is expected**
  Nothing starts perfect. Everything gets better.

* **Calm, minimal design**
  Design should support function, not compete with it.

* **Quiet confidence**
  We don't over-explain. The work speaks.

## Branding Rules

### Name

**Probably Fine Studios**
Always written in title case.

Usage example:

```
by Probably Fine Studios
```

---

### Logo Lockup

```
Probably Fine
      Studios
```

* Left-aligned
* "Probably Fine" is primary
* "Studios" is secondary and lighter
* Black only
* Transparent background
* Vector-first (SVG is the source of truth)

---

### Symbol

* Single solid dot
* Black only
* No outline
* No effects
* Used for favicons, app icons, and subtle branding moments

The symbol has no literal meaning. Recognition comes from repetition.

---

## Color Policy

* Primary: Black (#000000)
* Background: Transparent or white
* No studio color palette

Individual products define their own colors.

---

## Usage Philosophy

Probably Fine Studios exists as a quiet signature, not a spotlight.

It may appear in:

* App footers
* About pages
* README files
* Splash screens (subtle)

It should never overpower the product itself.
